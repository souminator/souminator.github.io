subtitle: or..Why am I worth Knowing!
---

My name is Soumya Sharma and I'm currently pursuing Masters in Engineering Management from Duke University (Class of 2020) with a focus on Data Analytics. Before Duke, I was working as a Business Analyst in a Management Consulting firm back in India and have worked across a spectrum of industries - Healthcare, E-commerce, Cab Aggregator and Logistics.  

As a Business Analyst, I was responsible for conducting primary/secondary research, expert interviews, extracting key insights and suggesting key strategies from data collected to make an impact.  

To advance my data analytics skills, I'm currently learning python and machine learning. 

This was all about my professional life, but my hobbies are something that have changed my life in a positive way and keep me sane and alive :D 

* Dance ðŸ’ƒ: I'm a self taught dancer and have been dancing since I didn't even know how to walk !! I have participated and led my college dance team in India in various inter-college competitions. Dance is very close to my heart and it has taught me teamwork, precision and self-confidence. 

* Cooking ðŸ¥˜ : I started cooking regularly after moving to US in 2019. It started as a hobby but it taught me patience and taking risks. I often watch cooking videos online and try creating something new out of it.

So this was a little peek into my life but the reason I created this personal webpage is to keep sharing my learnings in the world of Data Science with you. 

Thanks for Reading Me!
